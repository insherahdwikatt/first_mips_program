# MIPS Integer Analysis Program

This MIPS Assembly program reads up to 20 positive integers from user input (range 1–999).  
It stops reading if the user enters -1 or after 20 values.

## 📋 Features

- Validates input range (1–999)
- Calculates and prints:
  - Average value (integer)
  - Count above average
  - Count below average
  - Count of 2-digit numbers
  - Count of even numbers
  - Count of odd numbers
  - Count of prime numbers
- Sorts numbers in ascending order and prints them

## 🛠️ Structure

- `is_prime`: a procedure to check if a number is prime
- `sort_array`: a procedure to sort the array in ascending order

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the `.asm` file in **MARS** or **SPIM**
2. Assemble & Go
3. Enter integers (1 to 999), or -1 to stop
